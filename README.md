# Productivity Prediction Data Analysis

Personal Data Science project using R for analysis with the dataset:

Productivity Prediction of Garment Employees [Dataset]. (2020). UCI Machine
Learning Repository. <https://doi.org/10.24432/C51S6D>.

### Context for analysis

The Garment Industry is one of the key examples of the industrial globalization
of this modern era. It is a highly labour-intensive industry with lots of
manual processes. Satisfying the huge global demand for garment products is
mostly dependent on the production and delivery performance of the employees in
the garment manufacturing companies.

So, it is highly desirable among the decision makers in the garments industry
to track, analyse and predict the productivity performance of the working teams
in their factories.

Objective: Analyze current data and propose a productivity prediction model.

### Code and Report
